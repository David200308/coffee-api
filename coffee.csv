Name,Content,Making Time,Making Method
Black,Just coffee,6 minutes,"1. Grind your coffee beans finely. Use approximately one part coffee for every two parts of water, or about 7 grams of coffee per shot. Tamp the grounds tightly into your espresso machine’s portafilter.
2. Put the portafilter into your espresso machine and place an espresso cup beneath the brew head. Start pulling the shot and start a timer at the same time.
3. Allow 30 milliliters of water to flow through your grounds for 25 to 30 seconds. Stop brewing once you hit the water amount and time frame.
4. Enjoy your short black coffee plain or with a sugar cube!"
Latte,Espresso + Steamed milk,10 minutes,"1. Make the espresso: Use an espresso machine or manual espresso maker to make two shots of espresso and pour it into a mug (or try our Aeropress Espresso).
2. Steaming method (espresso machine): Place the milk in a pitcher. Hold the steaming wand just below the surface of the milk until it doubles in size. This makes foamy froth. Then, move the steaming wand lower and near the side of the pitcher to create a spiral vortex. This makes the silky smooth microfoam bubbles and wet-paint texture that’s characteristic of a latte. Steam until the milk reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit (use a thermometer or judge by when your hand can’t hold the pitcher for more than a few seconds).
3. OR, heat the milk to scalding and foam it (without espresso machine): Heat the milk to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot to the touch but not simmering. Measure with a food thermometer, or you can approximate by testing with your finger. Use a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth milk into small, even bubbles. For a latte you’ll want small bubbles and lightly thickened milk (if you’re using a milk frother, don’t go too far: you want the milk to mix in with the coffee so you don’t need too much froth). For the French press method, note that it’s useful to have at least 1 cup to have more milk to work with: this makes enough for 2 drinks. We highly recommend reading How to Froth Milk if this is your first time frothing. Wait 30 seconds to 1 minute to get the foam to incorporate into the milk and separate slightly (exact timing depends on your foaming method).
4. Serve: Tap the milk container on counter and swirl it to break down any large bubbles. Pour milk into center of the espresso, ending with light foam. "
Cappuccino,Espresso + Steamed milk + Foam,10 minutes,"1. Make the espresso: Use an espresso machine or manual espresso maker to make two shots of espresso and pour it into a mug (or try our Aeropress Espresso).
2. Steaming method (espresso machine): Place the milk in a pitcher. Hold the steaming wand just below the surface of the milk until it doubles in size and is very foamy.

3. OR, heat the milk to scalding and foam it (without espresso machine): Heat the milk to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot to the touch but not simmering. Measure with a food thermometer, or you can approximate by testing with your finger. Use a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth the milk until it’s very foamy. For a cappuccino you’ll want a good amount of froth: you’re going for ⅓ espresso, ⅓ steamed milk and ⅓ foam. We highly recommend reading How to Froth Milk if this is your first time frothing. For the French press method, note that it’s useful to have at least 1 cup to have more milk to work with: this makes enough for 2 drinks.

Doppio,2oz Espresso,10 minutes,"1. You first need to grind your espresso to a consistency that is going to filter through your machine. This should be a fine grind that gives you a powdery result rather than a medium-course grind that is used for Aeropress, Chemex, or other types of coffee pots that require an over-the-top pout method. The use of water pressure is essential to create the best-tasting result by being forced out of your machine.
2. Make two separate amounts that will fit into your portafilter and tamp the contents so they are lightly packed. The rest of the work comes from waiting for your espresso to be extracted. After this is complete you add a new batch of espresso into the portafilter and repeat the same extraction.
3. If you have a hand pump espresso maker, you’ll need to use several repeated pumps to build up pressure. This not only allows the pressure to build while the espresso is filtering, but it adds a richer crema that gives espresso more character. This technique is what Érik Favre did who traveled through Italy to learn the secrets of what makes espresso taste superior. His hard work and attention to detail (with a little motivation from his Italian wife), led to the invention of the Nespresso machine.
4. When you’re done you simply add sugar or milk to your doppio and then drink right away.
"

"
Lungo,Long pulled espresso,5 minutes,"1. Grind the coffee: Grind the coffee until it’s very fine ground. Different roasts and brands of beans will require a different grind for your machine. You may need to do a few test runs to get it dialed in just right.
2. Pack and tamp the coffee grounds: Add the coffee grounds to the espresso basket (portafilter) until it’s slightly heaping over the top. Use the tamper to press the grounds evenly into the portafilter, pressing very firmly until it is fully compressed. It’s useful to have something to press onto for tamping so that you don’t damage the counter or filter. Place the portafilter on a folded towel before tamping, or the best tool is the ledge of a knock box (you can also use it to discard the used grounds). It’s important for the coffee grounds to be as even and straight as possible to get the best espresso shot.
3. Pull the shot: Place the portafilter in the espresso machine and press the button to pull the shot using Manual mode. This is the most important part of pulling a ristretto shot. Make sure it lasts 15 to 20 seconds, resulting in 1 ½ ounces coffee for a double ristretto, with a caramel-colored crema (compared to 25 to 30 seconds for a standard espresso doubleshot).
4. Consider any adjustments: It takes a while to hone in the grind of the coffee and the tamping process. Don’t worry if it’s not exactly right the first time! If you find that the shot is watery, use slightly more coffee grounds or use a finer grind on the coffee."
Macchiato,Espresso shot + Foam,10 minutes,"1. Make the espresso: Use an espresso machine or manual espresso maker to make one shot of espresso* and pour it into a mug (or try our Aeropress Espresso).
2. Steam the milk (espresso machine) or heat the milk to scalding: Start with ½ cup milk (you’ll only use ¼ cup foam.) Heat the milk to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot to the touch but not simmering. Measure with a food thermometer, or you can approximate by testing with your finger.
3. Froth the milk: Use the espresso machine or a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth milk into small, even bubbles. You’ll want lots of “dry foam” for a macchiato: the fluffy stuff! The milk frother is great for this type of foam. We highly recommend reading How to Froth Milk if this is your first time frothing.
4. Spoon the foam on top: Use a spoon to remove the top of the foam (dry foam) and gently place it on top of the espresso. You should use about ¼ cup foam for one drink. "
Mocha,Espresso + Chocolate + Steamed milk,10 minutes,"1. Make the espresso: Make a doubleshot of espresso, following the instructions in How to Make Espresso. Place the chocolate chips into the mug and pour the espresso on top.
2. Steaming method (espresso machine): Place the milk and syrup in a pitcher. Hold the steaming wand just below the surface of the milk until it doubles in size and is very foamy. Lower the steaming wand slightly until the milk reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit (use a thermometer or judge by when your hand can’t hold the pitcher for more than a few seconds). Go to How to Steam Milk for full instructions.
3. Foaming method (without espresso machine): Heat the milk and syrup to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is “scalding”: hot to the touch but not simmering. Measure with a food thermometer, or you can approximate by testing with your finger. Use a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth the milk until it’s very foamy (or shake it in a covered jar). For a mocha you’ll want a good amount of froth. We recommend reading How to Froth Milk if this is your first time frothing. For the French press method, note that it’s useful to have at least 1 cup to have more milk to work with: this makes enough for 2 drinks.
4. Serve: Swirl the milk container a few times. Pour milk and foam into center of the chocolaty espresso. If desired, top with chocolate shavings for garnish."

Flat White,Espresso + Steamed milk,10 minutes,"1. Prep for the flat white: Grind and tamp the espresso, but don’t pull it. Store your milk jug in the refrigerator: the colder the milk is the more time you have to get the right texture.  Or, rinse it in very cold water, dry and refrigerate for a few minutes. Fill your milk jug to just below the spout, about ¾ cup, using very fresh whole milk (or oat milk for vegan). 
2. Make the espresso: Use an espresso machine or manual espresso maker to make two shots of espresso and pour it into a mug (or try our Aeropress Espresso).
3. Steaming method (espresso machine): Heat the steam wand. Once prepared, place the wand just below the surface of the milk about ½ inch from the side, tilting the jug slightly. Keep it in that position for about 5 to 10 seconds, stretching the milk by about 20 to 25% in height, with very slight movements up and down. Once stretched and slightly foamy, lower the nozzle about another ½ inch and tilt the pitcher just enough to get a spinning vortex, which incorporates the foam, turning it into a velvety microfoam. Keep that still and spinning until the temperature is about 150 degrees Fahrenheit. (Using a pitcher with a temperature sticker is very helpful.) Turn off the steam before removing the wand from the jug. Wipe the wand with a clean cloth. Turn it on for 1 second to purge the nozzle.  Tap and swirl the pitcher to incorporate any bubbles on top. The final texture should look like wet paint or melted ice cream, smooth and velvety. You’ll use only about half of this quantity and can discard the rest (see the * note below). 
4. OR, heat the milk to scalding and foam it (without espresso machine): Heat the milk to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot to the touch but not simmering. Measure with a food thermometer, or you can approximate by testing with your finger. Use a milk frother, French press or whisk to froth milk into small, even bubbles.
